The ID must be a numerical value, for example 10. Note that this plugin is restricted to work on one section only, since most update services will consider i spam if it's not a real blog post. Good practice would be to create a blog section, and enter the ID for that section here."/>

Separate multiple service URLs with line breaks. You should not enter more than 10 services, since it would take a lot of time when you save your articles. Don't forget that every new entry should begin with http://"/>
